# Kittens API Project

Project Briefing
'This is a fast and straightforward project where you’ll set up a Rails app to 
be a data-producing API… which is just a fancy way of saying that all your 
controller methods will render data instead of HTML. Consider this a drill in 
quickly building a pure vanilla RESTful resource. We won’t be working with an 
external API until the next project.'

The complete step-by-step instructions can be found under the project page on 
The Odin Project's website:
